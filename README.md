# 8mmScanner
This script is used with the 8mm film scanner project - you can find on hackaday https://hackaday.io/project/167426-8mm-film-scanner
S8_scan_OCV.py is the actual scanning script. S8_cal_crop.py was first optional - it allows the calibration of the area to be cropped out, crops it and creates a movie using ffmpeg.
